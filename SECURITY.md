# Introduction to Ethical Hacking/Pentesting.

**Follow these steps to get started:**
1. Install linux on your system. **Kali Linux** recommended. Download `iso` from [here](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).
2. Learn basic linux commands.
3. Learn the basics of some programming languages (`HTML/CSS`, `JS`, `PHP`, `SQL`, `Python`)
For basics and in-short tutorials, watch [Derek's videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSX7fVd4OUFp_ODd86H0ZIY)

4. Learn these essential concepts:
  - Methods (mainly `GET` and `POST` methods)
  - IP (**I**nternet **P**rotocol)
  - DNS (**D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem)
  - SSH (**S**ecure **Sh**ell)
  - Telnet (**T**eletype **N**etwork)
  - Port

## Recommended learning
- Learn **Python**, as many tools/scripts are made out of it.
- Learn to use **Github**, as it is like a best friend to any hacker.
- Learn about [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/) (Open Web Application Security Project) community and its list of [top 10 vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project).
- learn basics of command line editors Vim and GNU nano.
- Learn some frequently used commands: 
```bash
cat, ls, vim, ping, file, find, du, pwd, env, chmod, wget, cron, telnet, gzip, bzip2, tar, base64, grep, nc, curl, strings, whatweb, wildcards and many more...
```

## Cyber Security Challenges/Practice
- Solve basic CTF problems from [Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) and [Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) on **OverTheWire**.
- After completing **Bandit** and **Natas**, move on to [Hack this site](https://www.hackthissite.org/)(contains challenges covering the basics and JS)
- Start doing challenges from [backdoor by SDSLabs](https://backdoor.sdslabs.co/), try solving previous CTF challenges from [**picoCTF**](https://picoctf.com/).
- Start participating in CTFs on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/). This will boost your problem solving skills.
- Solve previous questions of CTF and read Writeups.

## Branches of Cyber Security:
  1. Web security
  2. Network security
  3. Forensics
  4. Application Security
  5. Steganography
  6. Mobile Pentest,
  and so on..

## Advanced Learning
